# The explore-exploit tradeoff manifests as a traversal of decision space

How humans make decisions when the value of those decisions can be unclear and unstable is unknown. One fundamental problem in decision-making is when to depart from the familiar to explore unknown options. To explore one potential mechanism for how humans adapt their choices under uncertain conditions, we measured how the underlying decision processes that shape our choices responded to uncertain conditions. We found that a shift in the value of a given choice resulted in an immediate decrease in both the rate at which information is accumulated and the amount of evidence needed to make a decision. We interpret this initial decrease in the threshold to make a decision and the rate of information accumulation as an exploratory process, with the return to previous values as an expression of exploitation. To assess the potential neuromodulatory influence of noradrenaline on this relationship, we also recorded pupillometry data. We found no evidence that noradrenergic modulation affects these decision processes. Altogether, these results reveal how decision processes coordinate over time to promote adaptive decision-making in the face of change.
